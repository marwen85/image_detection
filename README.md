# Potato Disease Classification

## Setup for Python:

1. Install Python ([Setup instructions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide))

2. Install Python packages

```
pip3 install -r training/requirements.txt
pip3 install -r api/requirements.txt
```

3. Install Tensorflow Serving ([Setup instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/setup))



## Training the Model

1. Download the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).
2. Only keep folders related to Potatoes.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook in Browser.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `potatos.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
5. In cell #2, update the path to dataset.
6. Run all the Cells one by one.
7. Copy the model generated and save it with the version number in the `models` folder.



3. Your API is now running at `0.0.0.0:8000`


## Creating the TF Lite Model

1. Run Jupyter Notebook in Browser.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open `training/tf-lite-converter.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. In cell #2, update the path to dataset.
4. Run all the Cells one by one.
5. Model would be saved in `tf-lite-models` folder.



8. Your model is now deployed.
9. Use Postman to test the GCF using the [Trigger URL](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/http).
